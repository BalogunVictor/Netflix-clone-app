## About The Project
I built this application in Next JS and is hosted on Vercel. 
This app features user authentication with firebase as well as the firestore cloud storage database. 
This application is pulling movie data from an API the TMDB movie API and displaying different categories. 
It features horizontal sliding and a featured selection. 
The Recoil hook is also being implemented for app-wide state management.

This project allowed me to deeply approach the different aspects of a web application developed in Nextjs with typescript
